Answer: **Start with the settings mockups:** Sam explicitly asked for your sign-off in [Design reviews](https://chat.example.com/l/message/c%3A00000000bbbb0000bbbb000000000002/1700004200000?parentMessageId=1700003600000). Review them and give approval or concrete blockers. Then: 1. **Check the rollout-numbers request** in [Weekly sync](https://chat.example.com/l/message/c%3Ameeting_AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/1700000480000).

Answer: **First, close out the updated doc you promised Sam by Friday.** Today is Friday, and your next 1:1 is tomorrow at 9 AM. Confirm it was delivered; if not, prioritize finishing it. Sam also has an outstanding request to review a draft—don’t assume it’s the same document. Then tackle: 1. **Settings mockup sign-off:** Sam explicitly asked for your approval in [Design reviews](https://chat.example.com/l/message/c%3A00000000bbbb0000bbbb000000000002/1700004200000?parentMessageId=1700003600000). 2. **Rollout numbers:** Check whether Sam’s request in Weekly sync still needs a follow
